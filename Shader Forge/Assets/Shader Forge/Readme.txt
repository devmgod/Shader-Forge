README - SHADER FORGE BETA:
---------------------------

First off - Massive thanks for purchasing Shader Forge!
You hopefully can't wait to get started, but you should give this document a read, it's not that long :)


Website:
--------
http://www.acegikmo.com/shaderforge/  (Includes documentation, tutorials, links to forum threads, and more!)


Installation:
-------------
Put the "Shader Forge" folder in the project you want to use Shader Forge in.
If you have an old version of Shader Forge installed, remove the *entire* ShaderForge folder before installing the new one


Version Control:
----------------
When running Shader Forge with version control, be sure to add the "ShaderForgeInternal.mat" material to the ignore list. (This behaviour will be mitigated in future versions)


Legal Stuff / Licensing:
------------------------
Shader Forge is licensed per-seat, as with all other editor extensions, according to Unity's EULA.
This means that in order for a team to use Shader Forge, everyone who want to be able to open and edit shaders with it, needs their own license.


Selling shaders created in Shader Forge:
----------------------------------------
Selling shaders created in Shader Forge is currently not permitted - I encourage you to share it with the community instead, as I believe most people will!
If you, however, think you have a very very very special reason for your shader in particular that it should be allowed to be sold, send me a mail: webmaster@acegikmo.com 


Quick start:
------------
   Opening Shader Forge = Window -> Shader Forge
 	     	    Panning = Click and drag empty space
	     	    Zooming = (Coming later)
		   Adding nodes = RMB + select node OR drag from right panel and place
		   Moving nodes = Click and drag
	    Selecting nodes = Click to select, shift/control click to add to selection
	   Box select nodes = Hold Alt + Drag. Shift/control click to add to selection
      	 Deleting nodes = Select and press delete
   Deleting connections = Hold alt and drag RMB in empty space to start cutting lines.
  Disconnect connectors = Alt+RMB on connectors to disconnect them. Alternatively, hover the cursor over a connector and press delete or backspace


Mail:
-----
webmaster@acegikmo.com

Try to avoid sending me mails along the lines of "How do I make a shader that ________ ". Keep that to the forums so others can see it too.
I'm a single person working on this project and I can't (Unfortunately) answer every question at all times (but I will do my best to do so).
I'm hoping there will be a large community in the end, that can help each other out, that I'll then be a part of as well :)
