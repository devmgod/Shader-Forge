===========

For contributors
================
If you've been given access to this source, there are a few things you should know!
Let's start with the boring stuff

Legal
=====
Shader Forge is currently owned by Neat Corporation, and it has to remain that way, since copies are still being sold, and our studio of two is too small to handle the logistics and management of shared revenue.
In addition, the rights to Shader Forge might be sold to Unity in the future, which means we at Neat Corp and Unity, don't want to deal with all the legal hassles of what could happen if every contribution retained ownership.
Basically, to sound extra legal:

**[X] I, contributor of the Shader Forge project, hereby acknowledge that by contributing to this project and reading this, I surrender all rights and ownership of the code and assets I contribute to Neat Corporation. In addition, I will not contribute copyrighted code or assets, nor will I distribute the code or assets in the project to anyone else**

(Look, I even checked the box for you!)

This doesn't mean that I will take credit for code you've written, this is solely to dodge legal issues.
Feel free to add yourself to the credits of Shader Forge! Also, I'll most likely tweet every time I pull your code in.
I'll definitely mention you in the changelog too.

Practical
=========
* Many parts of my code is ugly and confusing. You have been warned!
* Test your features properly! Make sure serialization works, and use it in various cases.
* Make sure you don't push a huge line-ending change of an entire file. If you're using Source Tree, enable the "ignore whitespace" option!
* Always clean up any Debug.Log/Warning/Error/print messages that aren't supposed to be seen by users
