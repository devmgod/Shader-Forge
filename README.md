If you've been given access to this source, there are a few things you should know!
Let's start with the boring stuff

Legal:
=
Shader Forge is currently owned by Neat Corporation, and it has to remain that way, since copies are still being sold, and out studio of two is too small to handle the logistics and management of shared revenue.
The rights to Shader Forge might be sold to Unity in the future, which means we at Neat Corp and Unity, don't want to deal with all the legal hassles of what could happen if every contribution retained ownership.
Basically, to sound extra legal:

*[X] I, contributor of the Shader Forge project, hereby acknowledge that by contributing to this project and reading this, I surrender all rights and ownership of the code to Neat Corporation.*

(Look, I even checked the box for you!)
